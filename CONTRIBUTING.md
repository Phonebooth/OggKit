# How to contribute?
First of all. Thank you for considering to contribute to this project. 

## Issues
You are welcome to state your wishes in terms of [isssues](https://github.com/ybrid/ogg-swift/issues) in this project. Of course reporting of bugs is favored in this transparent way, too.

## Tests
We do not own all exisiting ios device types of the past and the future. So try running the script ```test.sh``` with your device and tell us about success or failure. Does the test script pass the tests on your mac? This will help us improve the power of this software.

## Tell us your needs
### package management
Currently we support integration with CocoaPods. You may tell us which type of package management you use.
